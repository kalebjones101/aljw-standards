# Alabama Justice Watchdog (ALJW)

## Standards, Scope, & Ethics

### 1. Mission

Alabama Justice Watchdog (ALJW) exists to **document, verify, explain, and publicly challenge** actions taken by public officials and public agencies in Alabama when those actions raise credible concerns of injustice, abuse of authority, or lack of accountability.

ALJW combines **fact-based documentation** with **public advocacy**, including speech at public meetings, social media awareness, and lawful protest, in order to press for transparency, accountability, and corrective action.

While ALJW engages in advocacy, it is committed to grounding that advocacy in **verifiable facts, accurate representation, and ethical restraint**.

---

### 2. Scope of Coverage

ALJW covers matters involving:

* Law enforcement agencies and officers (local, county, and state)
* County and municipal governments
* Public boards, commissions, and authorities
* Use of public power, public funds, and public authority

ALJW may actively support individuals or groups when their case raises broader public-interest concerns.

ALJW does **not** cover:

* Purely private disputes without a clear public-interest nexus
* Claims that cannot be substantiated beyond personal assertion
* Personal conduct unrelated to public duties

---

### 3. Core Principles

**Accuracy over speed**
Information is published only after reasonable verification. Being correct matters more than being first.

**Fairness and restraint**
Subjects are described in proportion to verified facts. Language is measured, not inflammatory.

**Transparency**
When information is incomplete, that limitation is clearly stated.

**Accountability**
Errors are acknowledged and corrected promptly.

---

### 4. Evidence & Verification Standards

Information may be treated as factual only if supported by at least one of the following:

* Official documents or records
* Audio or video recordings
* Direct observation (meetings, court proceedings)
* On-the-record statements from identifiable sources

When appropriate, multiple independent sources are sought.

Information **must not** be presented as fact if it is:

* Based solely on rumor or hearsay
* Anonymous without corroboration
* Speculative or inferential beyond the evidence

---

### 5. Language & Framing Rules

ALJW uses precise, neutral language.

* "Alleged" is used until facts are legally or independently established
* Titles and ranks are used accurately
* Loaded or emotional phrasing is avoided

ALJW does not:

* Assert intent without evidence
* Imply guilt where none has been established
* Use sarcasm, mockery, or personal attacks

---

### 6. Separation of Fact, Analysis, Opinion, and Advocacy

ALJW clearly distinguishes between:

* **Facts**: What is verified and documented
* **Analysis**: What the facts reasonably suggest, grounded in law, policy, or procedure
* **Opinion**: Value judgments or interpretations
* **Advocacy**: Calls for action, reform, or accountability based on the above

Advocacy is explicitly labeled and rooted in documented facts and disclosed reasoning.

---

### 7. Use of Comparisons, Patterns, and Systemic Critique

Cross-case comparisons and systemic critiques may be used when:

* Each referenced case is independently documented
* The comparison is relevant to policy, training, oversight, or accountability
* Differences between cases are disclosed

Patterns are framed as **concerns or indicators**, not conclusions, unless supported by sufficient evidence.

---

### 8. Subjects’ Right to Respond

When practical and appropriate, ALJW seeks comment from:

* The agency involved
* The individual(s) named

Lack of response is noted factually without editorialization.

---

### 9. Corrections & Updates

If an error is identified:

* It is corrected promptly
* The correction is noted transparently
* Original context is preserved where possible

Updates are timestamped and clearly labeled.

---

### 10. Advocacy Position & Conflicts of Interest

ALJW acknowledges that it may take an **advocacy position** in specific cases.

* Advocacy positions are disclosed clearly
* Factual reporting is not altered to fit an advocacy narrative
* Personal, financial, or familial relationships relevant to a case are disclosed

ALJW does not accept payment to influence its advocacy or reporting.

---

### 11. Ethical Limits

ALJW will not:

* Publish private personal information unrelated to public duties
* Interfere with active investigations
* Encourage harassment, threats, or vigilantism

Public accountability does not justify harm.

---

### 12. Ongoing Review

This document is a living standard. Practices may evolve as experience and circumstances require, but the commitment to fairness, accuracy, and restraint remains constant.
